# OSINT-Project
OSINT Project
	

The project is based on a real life incident (long) while a big group of corrupt and criminals gang, started using their power, connection and resources (including the government resources) to isolate, manipulate, control and backstab an innocent to conduct a hate crime in a foreign land.

The only thing that saved him (the innocent) is the real time OSINT (Open Source Intelligence) he keeps gathering and changing his tactics to deal with it.

This project simply describes the set of tools and techniques utilized to gather real time intelligence to deal with an adversary. This may further be enhanced depending on time availability.
